# javascript and calsses 
## DO javascript really have classes 
 yes , js does have claseees . this feature was introduced in es6  Classes in JavaScript provide syntactic sugar over the prototype-based inheritance that existed before ES6, making it easier to work with traditional class-based languages for developers who are familiar with those paradigms. Under the hood, JavaScript's classes still use prototypal inheritance.


## oops it a programmign par
-A programming paradigm is a fundamental style or approach to building the structure and elements of computer programs.

## object 
-collection of porperties and methods

## why use oop 
obje t literal 
An object literal in programming refers to a way of creating an object in languages like JavaScript, Python, and others by directly specifying its properties and methods within braces {} without the need for a class definition

## new keyword - when we use new keyword 
step-1 it creates an empty object which i scaleed instance

step-2 the constructor function is called which packs the arguments given 
ste 3 -  all the rguments are njected in this keyword


##  prototype
-In JavaScript, a prototype is an internal property associated with every object that is created using a constructor function or through object literals. It's a mechanism that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.

## Prototypal behavior in JavaScript refers to how objects inherit properties and behaviors from other objects. In simpler terms, it's about objects sharing and borrowing characteristics from other objects.
